# ActModelsUI

Instructions -

To run the Automation Tool, "main.py" script has to be opened with the latest version of Python.
(Python 3.10 was used to build the tool)

Before running the model, please ensure that the following Python modules are installed in your system -
streamlit - modelx - openpyxl - pandas - numpy - tqdm

There may be few more libraries that are not mentioned here but are necessary for the program to run. The user can install these first and run the program, and if any library is missing, it will be mentioned in the output as an error message.

Python libraries can be installed using pip.
Go to Command Line > Type "pip install <module>"
(You may be required to install pip as well if that's not installed either.)
